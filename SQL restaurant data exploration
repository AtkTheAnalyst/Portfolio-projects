-- Objective 1
-- Explore the items table
-- Your first objective is to better understand the items table by finding the number of rows in the table, the least and most expensive items, and the item prices within each category.

-- View the menu_items table and write a query to find the number of items on the menu
select * 
from menu_items;

select count(*)
from menu_items;


-- What are the least and most expensive items on the menu?
select *
from menu_items
order by price asc;

select *
from menu_items
order by price desc;

-- How many Italian dishes are on the menu? 
select count(*)
from menu_items
where category = 'Italian';


-- What are the least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu?

select category, price
from menu_items
where category = 'Italian'
order by price asc;

select category, price
from menu_items
where category = 'Italian'
order by price desc;

-- How many dishes are in each category? 

select category, count(item_name) as num_of_items
from menu_items
group by category;

-- What is the average dish price within each category?
select category, avg(price) as avg_dish_price
from menu_items
group by category;



-- Objective 2
-- Explore the orders table
-- Your second objective is to better understand the orders table by finding the date range, the number of items within each order, and the orders with the highest number of items.

-- View the order_details table. 
select * 
from order_details;

-- What is the date range of the table?
select * 
from order_details
order by order_date;

select min(order_date), max(order_date)
from order_details;


-- How many orders were made within this date range? 
select count(distinct(order_id))
from order_details;

-- How many items were ordered within this date range?

select item_id, count(item_id) as number_of_orders
from order_details
group by item_id;

-- Which orders had the most number of items?
select * 
from order_details;

select order_id, count(item_id) as num_of_items
from order_details
group by order_id;

-- How many orders had more than 12 items?
select count(*) from

(select count(item_id) as num_items, order_id
from order_details
group by order_id
having num_items > 12) as num_orders;
;


-- Objective 3
-- Analyse customer behaviour
-- Your final objective is to combine the items and orders tables, find the least and most ordered categories, and dive into the details of the highest spend orders.

-- Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table

select * from order_details as od
	left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;

-- What were the least and most ordered items? 

select item_name, count(order_details_id) as num_purchases
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
group by item_name
order by num_purchases desc;


-- What categories were they in?

select item_name, count(order_details_id) as num_purchases, category
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
group by item_name, category
order by num_purchases desc;

-- What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?

select order_id, sum(price) as total_spend
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
group by order_id
order by total_spend desc
limit 5;

-- View the details of the highest spend order. Which specific items were purchased?
-- from the previous query we found out that the highest spend order has order_id 440 
select *
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
where order_id = 440;

-- Let's dive deeper, how much of each category did they order?

select category, count(item_id) as num_items
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
where order_id = 440
group by category;

-- BONUS: View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders

select *
from order_details as od left join menu_items as mi on od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
where order_id in (440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675);
